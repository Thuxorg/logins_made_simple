        For users to be able to log in with face recognition or fingerprint authentication, they need to first register their face or fingerprint data with the system. Here is an outline of the process for registering and then logging in using these biometric methods.
Step-by-Step Flow

    User Registration
        The user registers with their username and password.
        After successful registration, the user can optionally register their face or fingerprint for biometric login.

    Face Registration
        After the user has registered their account, they can visit a page to register their face.
        The face registration page will capture the user’s face data and store it in the database.

    Fingerprint Registration
        Similar to face registration, the user can visit a fingerprint registration page.
        The fingerprint registration page will capture the user’s fingerprint data and store it in the database using WebAuthn.

    Login with Username/Password
        The user logs in with their username and password.

    Login with Face Recognition
        The user visits the face lock login page.
        The system captures the user’s face data and matches it against the stored face data in the database.

    Login with Fingerprint
        The user visits the fingerprint login page.
        The system captures the user’s fingerprint data and verifies it using WebAuthn.

WebAuthn Overview

WebAuthn (Web Authentication) allows web applications to use public-key cryptography for user authentication. This is ideal for passwordless authentication methods like fingerprints.
Setting Up WebAuthn

You need to set up a WebAuthn server-side library to handle the registration and authentication processes. There are libraries available for various languages like PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.

PHP WebAuthn Library
For PHP, you can use the web-auth/webauthn-lib library. First, install the library via Composer:WebAuthn Overview
